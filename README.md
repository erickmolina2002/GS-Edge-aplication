# Elderly Care Monitoring System

## Problem Description

The health and safety of elderly individuals left alone at home without any supervision is a significant concern. This project addresses the issue of ensuring the well-being of seniors by providing a monitoring system.

## Solution Overview

Our solution involves the implementation of a device that detects any movement within a room over a 24-hour period. If no movement is detected during this time, an alarm is triggered to alert caregivers or family members. If there is any movement, the system resets the timer, and the 24-hour countdown begins again.

## Setup and Execution

### Prerequisites

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- [Tinkercad Account](https://www.tinkercad.com/)

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/FIAP-PAULISTA/GS-Edge-aplication.git

3. Open the Arduino IDE and load the project.

4. Configure the timer setting for 24 hours by replacing the placeholder value (86400000) in the code with the desired time in milliseconds.

5. Upload the code to your Arduino board.

6. Visit the [Tinkercad Simulation](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/h1T8g3pRZLB-sensor-presenca) for a virtual demonstration.
